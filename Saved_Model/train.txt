Apparatus and method thereof for hybrid timing exception verification of an integrated circuit design
General
Timing Constraints are crucial to meet timing requirements of an Integrated Circuit (IC). Timing exceptions are specified so that certain paths of the design of the IC are not timed as they are not relevant for the speed of the IC. If a path is specified as an exception but it is indeed a timing-relevant path then the design may functionally fail due to timing violations ignored by the timing analysis tools. It is therefore extremely important to ensure that all timing exceptions are correctly specified. The Hybrid Timing Exceptions Verification uses static verification as well as dynamic verification to effectively verify correctness of such timing exceptions. The solution pin-points the errors in the exceptions specification with very low number of false errors that would require significant designer inputs and time to manually waive them.

Once data are prebalanced, statistical analyses can be performed on the data to diagnose disease. The system includes a normalizing module for obtaining a normalizing factors database from a screening population group to account for differences in spatial separation of impedance measurements. Once a set of normalizing factors is obtained, a prebalancing factor can be obtained that can further be used to adjust raw electrical measurements. Normalizing factors are applied to a smaller subset of measurements that are likely to better represent the body part as a whole.: This set of measurements is reduced further by eliminating a set of the measurements that can be biased by a presence of a disease in a body part. The remaining measurements for each body part are then averaged to obtain an overall measure of a body part electrical property. The quotient between these measures is then used to adjust raw measurements. The adjusted measurements remove the imbalance that might exist due to natural differences between body parts. Adjusted measurements are then used as an input to other methods to obtain more accurate disease diagnostics.

Wiring-optimal method to route high performance clock nets satisfying electrical and reliability constraints
Electrical
High performance clock distributions and similar wiring networks require improvements in reliability and performance. This is especially true when hierarchical wiring with different metal thicknesses is employed and when a smaller number of large, higher-power buffers are used to reduce timing variability. Routing of critical nets improves robustness, reliability, and resistance while minimizing track and power usage. The method further optimizes the use of multiple physical pins on buffers to achieve desired electrical criteria. This involves optimal selection of additional routing beyond what is needed to satisfy simple connectivity. The routing involves an iterative process to select and evaluate additional possible routes on multiple layers. Each iteration involves extraction and simulation or estimation, and additional routes are added until the desired electrical criteria are met.

Method and system for performing phrase/word clustering and cluster merging
General
Text classification has become an important aspect of information technology. Present text classification techniques range from simple text matching to more complex clustering methods. Clustering describes a process of discovering structure in a collection of characters. The invention automatically analyzes a text string and either updates an existing cluster or creates a new cluster. To that end, the invention may use a character n-gram matching process in addition to other heuristic-based clustering techniques. In the character n-gram matching process, each text string is first normalized using several heuristics. It is then divided into a set of overlapping character n-grams, where n is the number of adjacent characters. If the commonality between the text string and the existing cluster members satisfies a pre-defined threshold, the text string is added to the cluster. If, on the other hand, the commonality does not satisfy the pre-defined threshold, a new cluster may be created. Each cluster may have a selected topic name. The topic name allows whole clusters to be compared in a similar way to the individual clusters, and merged when a predetermined level of commonality exists between the subject clusters. The topic name also may be used as a suggested alternative to the text string. In this instance, the topic name of the cluster to which the text string was added may be outputted as an alternative to the text string.

Equalizer, using krakovian algebra, for multicarrier transmission
Algebra
The present invention provides an optimal procedure for determining in the time domain equalizer coefficients for an equalizer, where the equalizer compensates for the effects of the communications channel on the transmitted signal. A unit pulse is transmitted over the communications channel, and a channel impulse response is estimated from the received signal. A cost function establishes a mean-square error associated with the estimated channel impulse response as compared to a desired impulse response signal. The value of the cost function varies based upon an offset value between the estimated channel impulse response and an equalized channel impulse response. Values of the cost function are determined for different offsets, and the offset that produces the smallest cost function value (corresponding to the minimum mean-square error) is selected. The optimal equalizer coefficients are then calculated using the selected offset and the established cost function. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is applied to multicarrier modulation systems. Moreover, the cost function is defined as a krakovian function that depends on the offset value. That krakovian function includes a first krakovian which uses the channel impulse response and a second krakovian which uses the autocorrelation of the channel impulse response. Using the first and second krakovians and the selected offset corresponding to the minimal value of the established cost funciton, the optimal equalizer coefficients are determined in a straightforward, one step calculation.

Damascene process to eliminate copper defects during chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) for making electrical interconnections on integrated circuits
Electrical
A novel copper damascene method for making metal interconnections on semiconductor integrated circuits was achieved. This method avoids overpolishing into a low-k dielectric fluorine-doped glass which would cause copper-flake defects resulting in intralevel electrical shorts. The method utilizes a stacked hard-mask layer on the doped glass layer consisting of a first polish-stop layer, a sacrificial insulating layer and an upper second polish-stop layer. After etching trenches in the stacked hard-mask layer and the doped glass, a copper layer is deposited to fill the trenches and is polished back to the second polish-stop layer. The high polish-back selectivity of the copper to the second polish-stop layer results in improved polish-back uniformity across the substrate. The relatively thin second polish-stop layer can then be polished back and partially into the sacrificial layer without overpolishing and damaging the underlying first polish-stop layer. The sacrificial layer is then removed to complete a level of metal interconnections. The method can be repeated to complete the multilevel of interconnections.
